# Managed inference relay (S1) — provider coverage

## Audit: the provider this service must support first is OpenRouter

**Conclusion: OpenRouter must be a first-class protocol here, and OpenRouter's
absence from the relay allowlist was a real coverage gap — not a deliberate
policy.** The evidence:

- The plan names it directly: Masterplan3 M6 item 7 says "The current allowlist
  omits OpenRouter and uses a fixed tested-model matrix" and asks for the
  intended provider to be implemented and proven, not mocked.
- Nora's own catalog already ships OpenRouter as a managed provider:
  `backend-api/llmProviders.ts` (`{ id: "openrouter", name: "OpenRouter",
  envVar: "OPENROUTER_API_KEY", models: [] }`), with the same entry in
  `workers/provisioner/worker.ts`.
- Nora treats OpenRouter as a native managed provider for its runtimes, not a
  custom URL: `backend-api/authSync.ts` and the provisioner worker map it as
  `{ provider: "openrouter", baseUrl: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1" }`, its
  default model is `openrouter/auto`, and the Docker/K8s/Proxmox/NemoClaw
  backends all inject `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- This operator's environment runs models through OpenRouter (Hermes
  `model.provider=openrouter`), so a relay that only speaks the other catalog
  providers cannot serve the intended account.
- The omission was visible in the fixed matrix: `policy.mjs` had no
  `openrouter` entry, so `parseAccountProviderMap` rejected such rows, model
  discovery returned nothing, and `provider_protocol_unavailable` failed
  closed. The plan's stated fix — implement only the required protocol(s),
  derive selectable models from the assigned provider configuration filtered by
  tested capabilities — is what this change does.

Deliberately **not** implemented: `/responses` (stays unsupported for every
provider), Anthropic/Gemini/Cohere/Microsoft Foundry/Ollama/OAuth-only providers
and the Nora demo stub (unchanged, still fail closed).

## Supported protocols

- OpenAI-compatible `GET /v1/models` and `POST /v1/chat/completions` only.
- **OpenRouter** (new): fixed endpoint
  `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`, bearer auth from the assigned
  provider row's decrypted key, `redirect: 'error'` (redirects never followed),
  request/response bodies relayed unchanged (messages, multimodal parts, tools,
  `tool_choice`, stream options, reasoning parameters), SSE bytes streamed
  without buffering, client disconnect/timeout aborts the upstream request, no
  fallback model and no retry.
- Endpoints stay allowlisted per provider (`policy.mjs` `PROVIDER_ENDPOINTS`):
  https only, exact host list, no port/IP/userinfo/query; a provider row's saved
  base URL can only narrow to the same host, otherwise the request fails closed
  with `provider_endpoint_forbidden`.
- Error translation (`safeProviderError`): 400/404/422 → 400
  `provider_request_rejected`; 401/403 → 502 `provider_authentication_failed`;
  429 → 429 `provider_rate_limited` (with safe `retry-after`); everything else,
  including OpenRouter's 402 (credits), → 502 `provider_error`. Provider
  response bodies are never returned to the client.

## Model derivation

Selectable models for a request are the **models configured on the assigned
provider row** (`provider.models` from Nora's resolver) intersected with the
**models this relay has actually covered** in `TESTED_PROVIDER_COVERAGE`
(`policy.mjs`), then narrowed by the optional per-account `models` list in the
trusted account map. Consequences:

- The old gate ("fixed tested-model matrix only") is gone; a configured model is
  exposed only while its provider coverage entry lists it.
- The assignment path may pass **no** per-account model list: derivation works
  from the provider row alone. A row that configures no models at all (the
  OpenRouter catalog ships `models: []`) falls back to the provider's covered
  set, so the protocol is usable without per-account lists.
- An untested model id never reaches the provider: `model_not_allowed` (400) is
  returned before any upstream call. `openrouter/auto` — a real alias Nora
  defaults to elsewhere — is deliberately withheld until a live test covers it.
- `TESTED_MODELS` is kept as a derived, frozen view of the coverage table for
  the relay's durable-assignment protocol gate (`lib.mjs`), so the two views
  cannot drift; OpenRouter is now included there as well.

## Capability table

Coverage surface = `['chat', 'streaming', 'tool_calls']` — the whole
OpenAI-compatible completion surface the relay carries; `/responses` is not part
of it. "Covered models" are the ids the live suite exercises end to end.

## Live-test evidence

New test file: `provider.live.test.mjs`. Run from
`services/headmaster-inference/`:

```sh
# offline + hermetic relay wiring / policy / route checks (always runs)
node --test *.test.mjs

# real-endpoint auth-failure probe for OpenRouter (deliberately invalid key)
HEADMASTER_INFERENCE_LIVE=1 node --test provider.live.test.mjs

# full real-provider suite: chat, streaming, tool calls, cancellation, errors
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<key> node --test provider.live.test.mjs
# (optional) HEADMASTER_LIVE_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat to try another id
```

Observed in this environment (2026-09-24):

- `node --test *.test.mjs` → **38 tests, 31 pass, 7 skipped, 0 fail**. The seven
  skips are the Redis-dependent quota tests (`REDIS_URL` unset) and the five
  key-gated `live:` tests (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` unset).
- `HEADMASTER_INFERENCE_LIVE=1 node --test provider.live.test.mjs` → **5 pass,
  4 skipped, 0 fail**, including the real-endpoint probe: the relay sent a
  completion request with a deliberately invalid credential to the real
  `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`, received OpenRouter's real
  `401 {"error":{"message":"User not found.","code":401}}`, and returned `502
  provider_authentication_failed` with exactly one upstream call (no retry) and
  no provider body or credential in the client response. This exercises the
  OpenRouter protocol end to end over the network up to the auth boundary and
  the error-mapping path.
- Public catalog metadata (unauthenticated
  `GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`) for the covered model:
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` — context 1,048,576, modalities text+image,
  `supported_parameters` include `max_tokens`, `tools`, `tool_choice`,
  `structured_outputs` (so the max_tokens default the relay injects and the
  tool-call scenario are within the model's declared surface).

**Update, 2026-09-25 (owner-approved funded run, Headmaster-Ecosystem plan
task 5.7):** the operator supplied the trial key
(`C:\Users\Matve\Documents\Headmaster-Ecosystem\.secrets\openrouter-trial.env`,
never printed or committed) for a full key-gated run of the third command
above, against `HEADMASTER_LIVE_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` (the
default — no override needed).

- `node --test *.test.mjs` (offline suite, no key loaded) → **40 tests, 33
  pass, 7 skipped, 0 fail**. Skips: 2 Redis-dependent quota tests (`REDIS_URL`
  unset) and 5 key-gated `live:` tests (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` unset in this
  run).
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<trial key> node --test provider.live.test.mjs` → **9
  tests, 9 pass, 0 skipped, 0 fail**. Every `live:` test ran (none skipped):
  non-streaming chat completion, streaming SSE passthrough + usage accounting,
  one tool-call turn, client cancellation (upstream abort + reservation
  release verified against the real endpoint, not a stub), and the
  invalid-credential auth-failure probe. All against the real
  `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`, using a handful of small
  completions against the cheap `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` model (owner
  approved spending the trial key on this).

This supersedes the 2026-09-24 entry above: the key-gated chat/streaming/
tool-call/cancellation scenarios that were previously "not run in this
environment" are now run and passing against the real provider. The SSE
passthrough, usage-frame accounting, and cancellation abort/reservation-release
mechanics are now confirmed as provider evidence, not just harness
verification.

## Personal provider keys are outside the tested-model catalogue

Requests that carry a verified `byo_provider` claim use the user's own key
against the same fixed endpoints listed above, but the tested-model catalogue,
capability table and live-test evidence in this document do not apply to them.
The operator catalogue exists because Headmaster pays for and vouches for those
models; a user's own key spends their own account, so any well-formed model id
is forwarded and the provider is the authority on whether it exists. Nothing
here claims a user-key model works end to end. See "Personal provider keys" in
README.md.

## Relationship to the rest of M6

- `lib.mjs` (durable assignment path) can carry a mapping with no `provider`
  field; the protocol is taken from the provider row and gated through the
  derived `TESTED_MODELS` view. Because OpenRouter is now in the coverage table,
  OpenRouter provider rows pass that gate.
- The relay still never receives prompts from Nora's cloud runtime, never runs
  tools, and keeps a single completion surface; provider secrets stay in the
  private relay and are sent only as upstream bearer auth.
